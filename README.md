# Project Title

This is the Risk Return Analysis Application for challenge 4! I pull in one CSV file with prices from four funds and the S&P 500.
I do a daily return analysis and comparison and plot a chart to see the four funds and the S&P 500. I then create box plots
with and without the S&P 500 to compare the volatility of the S&P 500 to the funds, and to compare the funds with themselves.

That's it!
